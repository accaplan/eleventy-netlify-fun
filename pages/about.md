A project born out of a love for cooking, baking, fermenting, brewing, gathering. Food brings it all together. Less of a business per se, I think of it as a way to be a part of the Zurich food scene, and make some products I believe in. I also will use it as a platform to explore local source, seasonal produce, grains, biodynamic and regenerative agriculture, zero waste, and foraging. It has no specific goals, except to be honest and have fun.
